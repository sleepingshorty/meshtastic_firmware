> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Build ‚Äì Use at Your Own Risk**  
> This firmware modification is intended for **debugging** and **experimentation in stationary mesh networks**.  
> It is **not optimized for robustness, mobile use, or long-term deployment**.  
> The implementation is quick & dirty, tested only in the field, and may include hardcoded logic or unstable behavior.

This fork introduces several bot-style commands for radio diagnostics, routing transparency, and manual tuning of forwarding behavior. It is meant to help with understanding network dynamics in complex setups (e.g. fixed nodes on rooftops, multi-hop routing, etc.).

---

## ‚úÖ Available Bot Commands

### `/status_info`
Displays radio and routing statistics:  
- Sent / received packets  
- Duplicate packets  
- Dropped forwards  

### `/neighbor_info`
Lists currently detected **0-hop neighbors** (directly reachable nodes):  
- Includes Node ID  
- Shows last recorded SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

### `"ping"`
Responds to `"ping"` messages with:  
- Hop count  
- RSSI (signal strength)  
- SNR (signal-to-noise ratio)

### `/set_priority <3‚Äì8>`
Only as node admin!

Manually sets the **priority** for this client:  
- Lower value = higher priority (faster sending)  
- Example: `3 = high priority`, `8 = lowest priority`  
- Use `-1` to revert to default SNR-based behavior

### `/get_priority`
Displays the currently active **manual priority**, or reports fallback to the SNR-based logic if unset.

### `/set_rtm_count <n>`
Only as node admin!

Configures the **repeat-to-mute threshold**:  
- A node will retransmit a packet only if it has heard it from fewer than `n` other nodes  
- Default is `1` (classic repeat-to-mute)  
- Higher values (e.g., `2` or `3`) allow increased redundancy

### `/get_rtm_count`
Returns the current **RTM threshold value**:  
- Defines how many times a packet must be overheard before it is suppressed

### `/enable_tx`
Only as node admin!

Enables TX. **RTM threshold value**:  
- Enable TX. You can disable tx for energy saving or recover from a misconfiguration state

## Overview

This repository contains the official device firmware for Meshtastic, an open-source LoRa mesh networking project designed for long-range, low-power communication without relying on internet or cellular infrastructure. The firmware supports various hardware platforms, including ESP32, nRF52, RP2040/RP2350, and Linux-based devices.

Meshtastic enables text messaging, location sharing, and telemetry over a decentralized mesh network, making it ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency preparedness, and remote operations.
